### Automated Best Practice Detection

**Script**: `.github/scripts/detect-best-practices.py`

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Detect emerging best practices from organizational patterns.

Analyzes pattern acceptance rates and developer feedback to identify
practices worthy of documentation and promotion.
"""

import yaml
from pathlib import Path

def detect_emerging_practices():
    """Identify patterns that should be promoted to best practices."""
    
    # Load organizational patterns
    patterns_file = Path('knowledge-base/organizational-patterns/patterns.yaml')
    with open(patterns_file) as f:
        data = yaml.safe_load(f)
    
    high_value_patterns = []
    
    for pattern in data['patterns']:
        # Criteria for best practice promotion
        if (
            pattern['confidence'] >= 0.90 and
            pattern['success_metrics']['acceptance_rate'] >= 0.85 and
            pattern['occurrences'] >= 10
        ):
            high_value_patterns.append(pattern)
    
    return high_value_patterns

if __name__ == '__main__':
    practices = detect_emerging_practices()
    
    print(f"Found {len(practices)} patterns ready for best practice promotion:")
    for p in practices:
        print(f"  - {p['title']} (confidence: {p['confidence']}, "
              f"acceptance: {p['success_metrics']['acceptance_rate']})")
```

## Escalation and Decision Framework

### Decision Authority Matrix

| Decision Type | Authority | Input Required |
|---------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Minor config adjustment** (<5% impact) | Tech Lead | None |
| **Moderate config change** (5-15% impact) | Engineering Manager | Tech Lead recommendation |
| **Major config change** (>15% impact) | Engineering Leadership | Retrospective approval |
| **New quality check** | Engineering Manager | Developer feedback + pilot |
| **Quality check removal** | Engineering Leadership | Retrospective + metrics |
| **Emergency rollback** | Tech Lead (immediate) | Post-action review required |

### Escalation Path

```
Developer Issue → Tech Lead → Engineering Manager → Engineering Leadership

Escalation Criteria:
- Critical bug affecting >50% of PRs
- False positive rate >30%
- Review time >10 minutes average
- Developer satisfaction <3.5/5
```

### Emergency Response Process

**Trigger Conditions**:
- CodeRabbit causing merge blocks incorrectly
- Review time spiking >200% above baseline
- Mass developer complaints (>5 in 1 hour)

**Response Procedure**:
1. **Immediate** (0-15 min): Tech lead investigates
2. **Short-term** (15-60 min): Implement temporary fix or rollback
3. **Follow-up** (1-24 hours): Root cause analysis
4. **Resolution** (24-48 hours): Permanent fix deployed
5. **Retrospective** (within 1 week): Document lessons learned
