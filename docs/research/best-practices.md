## 4. Review Workflow Best Practices

### 4.1 Optimal Pull Request Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Developer Creates PR] --> B{Draft PR?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Manual Review Only]
    B -->|No| D[CodeRabbit Auto Review]
    D --> E[Linters & Security Scans]
    E --> F{Issues Found?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Developer Fixes]
    F -->|No| H[Human Review]
    G --> D
    H --> I{Approved?}
    I -->|Yes| J[Pre-merge Checks]
    I -->|No| G
    J --> K{Checks Pass?}
    K -->|Yes| L[Merge to Main]
    K -->|No| G
```

### 4.2 Recommended Workflows

**Small PRs (< 300 lines):**
1. Developer opens PR
2. CodeRabbit reviews within 2-3 minutes
3. Automated tests run in parallel
4. Developer addresses feedback
5. Single human reviewer approves
6. Merge on green CI

**Medium PRs (300-1000 lines):**
1. Developer opens draft PR
2. Use `@coderabbitai pause` during active development
3. Mark ready for review when stable
4. CodeRabbit full review
5. Two human reviewers (one senior)
6. Address all comments before merge
7. Run performance tests
8. Merge after stakeholder sign-off

**Large PRs (> 1000 lines):**
1. Break into smaller PRs if possible
2. Use `@coderabbitai review --incremental`
3. Focus reviews on critical paths
4. Multiple review rounds
5. Architecture review by tech lead
6. Staged rollout or feature flags
7. Post-merge monitoring

### 4.3 Review Commands Reference

```bash
# Request reviews
@coderabbitai review              # Review new changes
@coderabbitai full review         # Complete re-review
@coderabbitai review --incremental # Review only changed files

# Control workflow
@coderabbitai pause               # Pause auto-reviews
@coderabbitai resume              # Resume auto-reviews
@coderabbitai ignore              # Skip this PR

# Generate artifacts
@coderabbitai summary             # Generate PR summary
@coderabbitai generate docstrings # Add missing docstrings
@coderabbitai generate tests      # Create unit tests

# Configuration
@coderabbitai configuration       # Export current config
@coderabbitai help                # Show available commands
```

### 4.4 Workflow Optimization Strategies

**Reduce Review Latency:**
- Enable `auto_incremental_review: true` for real-time feedback
- Set `commit_status: true` to track review progress
- Use `collapse_walkthrough: false` for immediate visibility
- Configure `github-checks` integration for parallel execution

**Improve Review Quality:**
- Set `profile: assertive` for comprehensive feedback
- Enable all relevant linters and security scanners
- Use path-specific instructions for file types
- Implement pre-merge checks with appropriate thresholds

**Optimize Team Efficiency:**
- Use `suggested_reviewers: true` for intelligent assignments
- Enable `related_prs: true` to prevent duplicate work
- Set `auto_apply_labels: false` for manual control
- Configure `labeling_instructions` for consistent categorization

**Manage Large Codebases:**
- Use `path_filters` to focus on relevant files
- Exclude generated code and dependencies
- Enable `disable_cache: false` for faster reviews
- Set `abort_on_close: true` to save resources

## 5. Path-Specific Guidelines

### 5.1 File Type Review Matrix

| File Pattern | Primary Focus | Key Checks | Severity |
|--------------|---------------|------------|----------|
| `**/*.py` | Python code quality | PEP 8, type hints, security | High |
| `**/*.{ts,tsx}` | TypeScript/React | Type safety, hooks, performance | High |
| `**/*.test.*` | Test coverage | Assertions, mocks, edge cases | Medium |
| `**/api/**` | API security | Auth, validation, rate limiting | Critical |
| `**/models/**` | Data integrity | SQL safety, migrations, indexes | High |
| `**/*.{yml,yaml}` | Configuration | No secrets, validation, docs | Medium |
| `**/docker/**` | Container security | Base images, users, secrets | High |
| `**/*.md` | Documentation | Accuracy, examples, links | Low |

### 5.2 Directory-Specific Rules

```yaml
path_instructions:
  # Frontend Components

      - Accessibility (ARIA, keyboard navigation)
      - Performance (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback)
      - Storybook documentation
      - No business logic in components
  
  # Backend Services
  - path: "src/services/**/*.py"
    instructions: |
      Focus on:
      - Single Responsibility Principle
      - Proper error handling and logging
      - Input validation and sanitization
      - Database transaction management
      - Caching strategies
      - API documentation
  
  # Data Processing

**Python:**
- Type hints for all function signatures
- Docstrings in Google/NumPy format
- Context managers for resource handling
- List comprehensions over loops (when readable)
- `pathlib` over `os.path`
- `logging` module instead of `print()`

**TypeScript:**
- Strict mode enabled
- Explicit return types for functions
- Interfaces over type aliases for objects
- Readonly properties where applicable
- Discriminated unions for type safety
- Avoid `any` - use `unknown` if needed

**React:**
- Functional components with hooks
- Custom hooks for reusable logic
- Proper dependency arrays in effects
- Keys for list items
- Error boundaries for fault isolation
- Lazy loading for code splitting

```

### 6.3 Dashboard Implementation

**Recommended Tools:**
- **Grafana + Prometheus:** Track CodeRabbit API metrics
- **GitHub Insights:** PR cycle time and review distribution
- **Custom Analytics:** Parse CodeRabbit comments via API

**Sample Grafana Queries:**
```promql
# Average review time
avg(coderabbit_review_duration_seconds)

# Critical issues per week
sum(rate(coderabbit_issues_total{severity="error"}[1w]))

# Review acceptance rate
sum(coderabbit_suggestions_accepted) / sum(coderabbit_suggestions_total)
```

## 7. Real-World Implementation Examples

### 7.1 Appsmith Configuration (Low-Code Platform)

**Key Patterns from Appsmith:**

```yaml
# Enterprise-grade Cypress test review
path_instructions:
  - path: "app/client/cypress/**/**.*"
    instructions: |
      Review e2e test code using Cypress:
      - Follow best practices for Cypress code
      - Avoid using cy.wait in code
      - Avoid using cy.pause in code
      - Avoid using agHelper.sleep()
      - Use locator variables for locators
      - Use data-* attributes for selectors
      - Avoid Xpaths, Attributes and CSS path
      - Avoid selectors like .btn.submit
      - Perform logins via API
      - Avoid using it.only
      - Use multiple assertions
      - Avoid string assertions
      - Ensure unique filenames

# Professional tone for enterprise
tone_instructions: "You are an expert code reviewer in Java, TypeScript, JavaScript, and NodeJS. You work in an enterprise software developer team, providing concise and clear code review advice. You only elaborate or provide detailed explanations when requested."

# Assertive profile for thorough reviews
profile: "assertive"

# Review release branches
auto_review:
  base_branches: ["pg", "release"]
```

**Lessons from Appsmith:**
- Specific anti-patterns documented (what NOT to do)
- Test-specific selectors guidelines (data-* attributes)
- Focus on unique identifiers to prevent flaky tests
- Concise tone instruction within 250 char limit

### 7.2 Novu Configuration (Notification Infrastructure)

**Key Patterns from Novu:**

```yaml
# Microservices architecture focus
path_instructions:
  - path: "apps/api/**/*.ts"
    instructions: |
      Review API service code for:
      - NestJS best practices and decorators
      - Proper dependency injection
      - DTOs for request/response validation
      - Queue handling and worker patterns
      - Event-driven architecture patterns
      - Observability (logging, metrics, tracing)

  - path: "libs/**/*.ts"
    instructions: |
      Review shared library code ensuring:
      - Zero external dependencies where possible
      - Clear public API with TypeScript interfaces
      - Comprehensive unit tests
      - No breaking changes without version bump
      - Documentation of usage examples

# Integration with Jira
chat:
  integrations:
    jira:
      usage: "enabled"
knowledge_base:
  jira:
    usage: "enabled"
    project_keys: ["NOV", "ENG"]
```

**Lessons from Novu:**
- Microservices-specific review guidelines
- Shared library standards (dependency management)
- Event-driven architecture patterns
- Integration with enterprise tools (Jira)

### 7.3 OpenObserve Configuration (Observability Platform)

**Key Patterns from OpenObserve:**

```yaml
# Rust and performance-critical code
path_instructions:
  - path: "src/**/*.rs"
    instructions: |
      Review Rust code with focus on:
      - Memory safety and ownership patterns
      - Zero-copy optimizations where applicable
      - Proper error handling (Result types)
      - Performance benchmarks for critical paths
      - Concurrent programming safety (Send/Sync)
      - Documentation with examples

  - path: "src/service/**/*.rs"
    instructions: |
      Review service code for:
      - High-throughput data ingestion patterns
      - Query optimization for time-series data
      - Resource limits and backpressure handling
      - Graceful degradation under load
      - Observability of the observability system

# Enable Clippy for Rust
tools:
  clippy:
    enabled: true

# Focus on performance
labeling_instructions:
  - label: "performance-critical"
    instructions: "Apply when changes affect data ingestion, query performance, or memory usage"
```

**Lessons from OpenObserve:**
- Performance-critical code review patterns
- Language-specific linters (Clippy for Rust)
- High-throughput system considerations
- Custom labels for performance tracking

## 8. Anti-Patterns and Common Pitfalls

### 8.1 Configuration Anti-Patterns

**❌ DON'T:**

```yaml
# Too permissive - reviews everything
path_filters:
  - "**/*"

# No exclusions - wastes resources
path_filters:
  - "**/*.js"
  - "node_modules/**/*.js"  # Will review dependencies!

# Vague instructions
path_instructions:
  - path: "**/*.py"
    instructions: "Review this file"

# All tools enabled - slow and noisy
tools:
  eslint: { enabled: true }
  ruff: { enabled: true }
  pylint: { enabled: true }
  flake8: { enabled: true }  # Overlaps with Ruff
  # ... 20+ more tools

# Tone instruction exceeds limit
tone_instructions: "You are a highly experienced senior software engineer with deep expertise in multiple programming languages including Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and more. You should provide detailed, thoughtful code reviews that are both educational and actionable..." # > 250 chars

# Auto-apply everything - loses control
auto_apply_labels: true
auto_assign_reviewers: true
request_changes_workflow: false
```

**✅ DO:**

```yaml
# Targeted review scope
path_filters:
  - "src/**/*.{py,ts,tsx}"
  - "tests/**/*.{py,ts}"
  - "!**/node_modules/**"
  - "!**/dist/**"
  - "!**/__pycache__/**"

# Specific, actionable instructions
path_instructions:
  - path: "**/*.py"
    instructions: |
      Focus on: PEP 8 compliance, type hints, security (SQL injection,
      command injection), proper exception handling, and performance.

# Complementary tools without overlap
tools:
  ruff: { enabled: true }      # Python (replaces flake8)
  eslint: { enabled: true }    # JavaScript/TypeScript
  gitleaks: { enabled: true }  # Security
  semgrep: { enabled: true }   # Advanced patterns

# Concise, professional tone
tone_instructions: "Expert code reviewer providing concise, actionable feedback. Focus on security, performance, and maintainability. Direct but constructive."

# Controlled automation
auto_apply_labels: false        # Human verification
auto_assign_reviewers: false    # Manual assignment
request_changes_workflow: true  # Require resolution
```

### 8.2 Review Process Pitfalls

**Common Mistakes:**
1. **Ignoring CodeRabbit comments** - AI finds real issues
2. **Too large PRs** - Break into smaller chunks (< 500 lines)
3. **Insufficient context** - Write clear PR descriptions
4. **Skipping tests** - Enable `auto_incremental_review` for test coverage
5. **Dismissing security warnings** - Investigate all security issues
6. **Not using commands** - Leverage `@coderabbitai` commands
7. **Disabled pre-merge checks** - Enable quality gates
8. **Manual label application** - Use `labeling_instructions`

### 8.3 Team Adoption Challenges

**Challenge:** Developers ignore AI reviews
**Solution:** 
- Set `request_changes_workflow: true`
- Track comment resolution rates
- Gamify review participation

**Challenge:** Too many false positives
**Solution:**
- Refine `path_instructions` based on feedback
- Add exclusion patterns to AST-grep rules
- Adjust linter configurations

**Challenge:** Reviews too slow
**Solution:**
- Enable caching: `disable_cache: false`
- Use `path_filters` to reduce scope
- Increase `github-checks` timeout if needed

**Challenge:** Inconsistent review quality
**Solution:**
- Standardize `tone_instructions`
- Create team-specific `path_instructions`
- Regular configuration audits
