# Request Changes Workflow - Quality Gate Enforcement

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-10-14  
**Purpose:** Configuration and usage guide for automated PR blocking via CodeRabbit request changes workflow

---

## Overview

The Request Changes Workflow automatically blocks PR merges when critical quality gate failures are detected. This enforcement mechanism integrates CodeRabbit reviews with GitHub status checks to prevent non-compliant code from reaching production.

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ Automated PR blocking for critical failures (security, breaking changes)
- ‚úÖ GitHub status check integration for merge prevention
- ‚úÖ Clear remediation guidance in PR comments
- ‚úÖ Override mechanism with justification requirements
- ‚úÖ Automatic retry for transient failures
- ‚úÖ Team notification and escalation procedures

## How It Works

### Workflow Sequence

```
1. Developer creates/updates PR
   ‚Üì
2. CodeRabbit analyzes code changes
   ‚Üì
3. Quality checks execute (error mode for critical checks)
   ‚Üì
4. If CRITICAL failure detected:
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí CodeRabbit posts "Request Changes" review
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí GitHub status check set to "failure"
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Merge button blocked
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí Notification posted with remediation guidance
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí Developer must fix or request override
   ‚Üì
5. Developer fixes issue and pushes
   ‚Üì
6. CodeRabbit re-evaluates automatically
   ‚Üì
7. If checks pass:
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí CodeRabbit approves PR
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚Üí GitHub status check set to "success"
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚Üí Merge button enabled
```

### Configuration

**File:** `.coderabbit.yaml`

```yaml
reviews:
  # ENABLED: Request changes workflow blocks PRs with critical failures
  request_changes_workflow: true

quality_checks:
  # ENFORCED: Error mode blocks merge via GitHub status checks
  mode: error
  
  # Critical checks (always error mode)
  custom_checks:
    security:
      enabled: true
      mode: error  # Blocks merge
      retry_on_transient_failure: true
      max_retries: 3
    
    breaking_changes:
      enabled: true
      mode: error  # Blocks merge
      retry_on_transient_failure: true
      max_retries: 3
```

## GitHub Status Check Integration

### Status Check Context

**Name:** `CodeRabbit Quality Gates`

**States:**
- ‚úÖ **success**: All quality gates passed
- ‚ùå **failure**: One or more critical failures detected
- ‚è≥ **pending**: Checks in progress

### GitHub Actions Workflow

**File:** `.github/workflows/quality-gate-status.yml`

**Triggers:**
- PR opened
- PR synchronized (new commits pushed)
- PR reopened
- CodeRabbit review submitted

**Jobs:**
1. **quality-gate-enforcement**: Runs quality checks and creates status
2. **check-coderabbit-approval**: Verifies CodeRabbit review state

**Artifacts:**
- Quality check results (JSON)
- Detailed failure reports
- Retention: 30 days

### Integration with Branch Protection

The GitHub status check can be added to branch protection rules to enforce quality gates at the repository level.

**Setup:**
1. Go to repository Settings ‚Üí Branches
2. Edit branch protection rule for `main`
3. Enable "Require status checks to pass before merging"
4. Add required status check: `CodeRabbit Quality Gates`
5. Enable "Require branches to be up to date before merging"

---

## Critical vs Warning Mode Checks

### Error Mode (Blocks Merge)

**When Used:**
- Security vulnerabilities (hardcoded credentials, SQL injection, etc.)
- Breaking changes without documentation
- PR title format violations

**Behavior:**
- ‚ùå CodeRabbit requests changes
- ‚ùå GitHub status check fails
- ‚ùå Merge button disabled
- üìß Team notification sent

**Checks in Error Mode:**
```yaml
- hardcoded-credentials (CRITICAL)
- sql-injection (CRITICAL)
- sensitive-data-logging (HIGH)
- unsafe-deserialization (CRITICAL)
- api-signature-changes (HIGH)
- removed-public-methods (CRITICAL)
- pr-title-format (ENFORCED)
```

### Warning Mode (Allows Merge)

**When Used:**
- Architecture suggestions
- Performance recommendations
- Documentation completeness
- Code organization

**Behavior:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è CodeRabbit posts review comments
- ‚úÖ GitHub status check passes (with warnings)
- ‚úÖ Merge button enabled
- üìä Warnings logged for metrics

**Checks in Warning Mode:**
```yaml
- docstring-coverage (85% threshold)
- layer-separation (architectural)
- dependency-injection (pattern enforcement)
- async-patterns (best practice)
- n-plus-one (performance)
- database-indexes (optimization)
- algorithm-complexity (efficiency)
```

---

## Automatic Retry Mechanism

### Transient Failure Handling

**Purpose:** Prevent false positives from temporary issues (network errors, API rate limits, service outages)

**Configuration:**
```yaml
custom_checks:
  security:
    retry_on_transient_failure: true
    max_retries: 3
    retry_delay_seconds: 5
    backoff_multiplier: 2  # Exponential backoff
```

**Retry Logic:**
1. Initial check fails with transient error (network timeout, 5xx error)
2. Wait 5 seconds
3. Retry attempt 1
4. If fails, wait 10 seconds (backoff)
5. Retry attempt 2
6. If fails, wait 20 seconds (backoff)
7. Retry attempt 3
8. If still fails, report as genuine failure

**Transient Error Types:**
- Network timeouts
- HTTP 5xx errors (server issues)
- API rate limit errors (429)
- Temporary service unavailability

**Non-Transient Errors (No Retry):**
- Code quality violations
- Security vulnerabilities
- Breaking changes

---

## Developer Workflow

### When PR is Blocked

**Step 1: Review Failure Details**

Check the PR for:
- ‚ùå "Changes requested" review from CodeRabbit
- ‚ùå Failed "CodeRabbit Quality Gates" status check
- üìù Detailed comment with remediation guidance

**Example Comment:**
```markdown
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Quality Gate Failure - Merge Blocked

This PR has been blocked due to 2 critical quality gate failure(s).

### Failed Checks
- **hardcoded-credentials** (critical): Hardcoded API key detected in config.py:42
- **sql-injection** (critical): Potential SQL injection in user_service.py:156

### Next Steps
1. Review failed checks above
2. Fix issues according to remediation guidance
3. Push changes (CodeRabbit will automatically re-evaluate)
4. Request override if false positive (see below)
```

**Step 2: Fix Issues**

Address each failure:

```python
# ‚ùå BEFORE (hardcoded credential)
API_KEY = "sk_live_abc123xyz"

# ‚úÖ AFTER (environment variable)
import os
API_KEY = os.environ.get("API_KEY")
if not API_KEY:
    raise ValueError("API_KEY environment variable not set")
```

```python
# ‚ùå BEFORE (SQL injection)
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '{email}'"
cursor.execute(query)

# ‚úÖ AFTER (parameterized query)
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?"
cursor.execute(query, (email,))
```

**Step 3: Push Fixes**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: address quality gate failures"
git push
```

**Step 4: Automatic Re-evaluation**

- CodeRabbit automatically re-runs checks on new commits
- GitHub Actions workflow re-executes
- If checks pass:
  - ‚úÖ Status check updates to "success"
  - ‚úÖ Merge button enabled
  - ‚úÖ CodeRabbit approves PR

---

## Override Process

### When to Use Overrides

**Valid Reasons:**
- False positive detection
- Test data or fixtures (not production code)
- Legacy code with documented exceptions
- Approved architectural deviation

**Invalid Reasons:**
- "I don't have time to fix this"
- "It works on my machine"
- "We'll fix it later"
- No justification provided

### Override Command Syntax

**Format:**
```
@coderabbitai ignore <check-name> --reason "Detailed justification (minimum 50 characters)"
```

**Examples:**

‚úÖ **Good Override:**
```
@coderabbitai ignore hardcoded-credentials --reason "Public test API key from Stripe documentation used exclusively in test fixtures. Not a security risk as it's rate-limited and cannot access production data."
```

‚ùå **Bad Override:**
```
@coderabbitai ignore hardcoded-credentials --reason "It's fine"
```
(Rejected: Justification too short and lacks detail)

### Available Override Checks

**Architectural Checks** (Tech lead approval recommended):
- `layer-separation`
- `dependency-injection`
- `async-patterns`

**Testing Checks** (Tech lead approval recommended):
- `new-functions-tests`
- `bug-fix-regression`

**Performance Checks** (Context-dependent):
- `n-plus-one`
- `database-indexes`
- `algorithm-complexity`

**Documentation Checks**:
- `docstring-coverage`

### Non-Overridable Checks

**Always Enforced (No Override Allowed):**
- ‚ùå `hardcoded-credentials`
- ‚ùå `sql-injection`
- ‚ùå `sensitive-data-logging`
- ‚ùå `unsafe-deserialization`
- ‚ùå `api-signature-changes` (must update CHANGELOG)
- ‚ùå `removed-public-methods` (must update CHANGELOG)
- ‚ùå `pr-title-format`

**Rationale:** Critical security and compliance requirements

### Elevated Permission Overrides

**Security Checks** require elevated permissions:

**Authorized Roles:**
- @kellerai/security-team
- @kellerai/admins

**Process:**
1. Developer identifies false positive security check
2. Developer comments explaining issue
3. Developer mentions `@kellerai/security-team` for review
4. Security team member reviews and provides override if appropriate
5. Override logged to audit trail

---

## Escalation Procedures

### Level 1: Standard Override (Self-Service)

**Timeframe:** Immediate  
**Applies to:** Non-critical checks (architecture, testing, performance)

**Process:**
1. Developer posts override command with 50+ character justification
2. CodeRabbit processes override
3. Check marked as `[IGNORED]` in review
4. PR can proceed to merge
5. Override logged for compliance tracking

### Level 2: Tech Lead Approval

**Timeframe:** Same day (4-hour SLA)  
**Applies to:** Architectural deviations, test coverage exceptions

**Process:**
1. Developer mentions `@kellerai/tech-leads` in comment
2. Developer explains business justification (why urgent, impact of delay)
3. Tech lead reviews within 4 hours
4. If approved:
   - Tech lead comments: `@coderabbitai ignore <check> --reason "<tech lead justification>"`
   - Override logged with tech lead as authorizer
5. If rejected:
   - Tech lead provides guidance on proper fix
   - Developer implements fix and pushes

**Example:**
```markdown
@kellerai/tech-leads - Need override approval for `layer-separation` check.

**Business Justification:**
Customer demo scheduled for tomorrow morning. This is a temporary direct database call 
in the controller to work around a critical bug in the repository layer. 

**Remediation Plan:**
- Ticket TECH-456 created to properly refactor to repository pattern
- Scheduled for next sprint (sprint 24)
- Temporary code marked with TODO comment and ticket reference

**Risk Assessment:**
Low risk - only affects admin panel used by internal team, not customer-facing API.
```

### Level 3: Security Team Review

**Timeframe:** 1 business day  
**Applies to:** Security check overrides only

**Process:**
1. Developer mentions `@kellerai/security-team` with detailed analysis
2. Developer must provide:
   - Exact code in question
   - Why check flagged it
   - Why it's not a genuine security issue
   - Supporting evidence (documentation, vendor guidelines)
3. Security team reviews:
   - Code context
   - Risk assessment
   - Alternative solutions
4. Security team decision:
   - **Approved:** Override granted with security team justification
   - **Alternative Required:** Guidance on secure implementation
   - **Rejected:** Code must be changed

**Example:**
```markdown
@kellerai/security-team - Security check false positive review request

**Check:** hardcoded-credentials  
**File:** `tests/fixtures/payment_fixtures.py:23`  
**Code:**
```python
STRIPE_TEST_KEY = "pk_test_123abc"  # Stripe test publishable key
```

**Analysis:**
This is a Stripe test publishable key (pk_test_*) from their official documentation.
- NOT a secret key (would be sk_test_*)
- Only works in test mode (cannot charge real cards)
- Public by design (safe to commit, per Stripe docs)
- Used exclusively in test fixtures

**Evidence:**
Stripe documentation: https://stripe.com/docs/keys#test-live-modes
"Publishable keys are meant to be public and can be safely included in client-side code."

**Risk Assessment:** Zero risk - this is a public test key by design.

**Request:** Override approval for this specific test key instance.
```

### Level 4: Emergency Override

**Timeframe:** Immediate (with post-incident review)  
**Applies to:** Production incidents, critical hotfixes

**Process:**
1. **Incident declared** via on-call process
2. Developer creates hotfix PR with `[INCIDENT]` prefix
3. Developer mentions `@kellerai/admins` for emergency override
4. Admin provides blanket override:
   ```
   @coderabbitai ignore all-checks --reason "INCIDENT-789: Production outage. Quality gates temporarily bypassed for emergency hotfix. Post-incident review required."
   ```
5. PR merged immediately
6. **Post-incident review** (within 24 hours):
   - Review what checks failed
   - Assess if failures are genuine issues
   - Create follow-up tickets for proper fixes
   - Update incident report

**Audit Requirements:**
- Incident ticket number required
- Post-incident review documented
- Follow-up remediation tickets created
- Logged in incident tracking system

## Branch Protection Setup

### Recommended Configuration

**GitHub Repository Settings ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí main**

```yaml
Branch Protection Rules:
  ‚úÖ Require a pull request before merging
  ‚úÖ Require approvals: 1
  ‚úÖ Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
  ‚úÖ Require review from Code Owners
  
  ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
    Required status checks:
      - CodeRabbit Quality Gates
      - quality-gate-enforcement
      - check-coderabbit-approval
  
  ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging
  ‚úÖ Require conversation resolution before merging

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: PR Blocked But Checks Show Passing

**Symptoms:**
- CodeRabbit requested changes
- GitHub status check shows "success"
- Merge still blocked

**Cause:** CodeRabbit review takes precedence over status check

**Resolution:**
1. Check CodeRabbit review details
2. Address any comments or requested changes
3. If review is stale, trigger re-review:
   ```
   @coderabbitai review
   ```

### Issue: Status Check Stuck in "Pending"

**Symptoms:**
- Quality gate status shows "pending" indefinitely
- GitHub Actions workflow not running

**Cause:** Workflow trigger conditions not met or GitHub Actions quota exceeded

**Resolution:**
1. Check GitHub Actions tab for workflow status
2. Re-trigger workflow:
   - Close and reopen PR, OR
   - Push new commit
3. If quota exceeded, contact DevOps for quota increase

### Issue: False Positive Security Check

**Symptoms:**
- Security check flags test data or documented pattern
- Developer believes it's safe

**Process:**
1. Do NOT override security checks directly
2. Mention `@kellerai/security-team` with detailed analysis
3. Provide context and evidence (documentation, vendor guidelines)
4. Wait for security team review and approval
5. Security team will provide override if appropriate

### Issue: Check Fails Intermittently

**Symptoms:**
- Quality check passes sometimes, fails others
- No code changes between runs

**Cause:** Likely transient failure (network, API rate limit)

**Resolution:**
1. Check if automatic retry is enabled:
   ```yaml
   retry_on_transient_failure: true
   max_retries: 3
   ```
2. Review GitHub Actions logs for specific error
3. If persistent, report to DevOps:
   - Include workflow run URL
   - Describe failure pattern
   - Attach logs

### Issue: Emergency Hotfix Blocked

**Symptoms:**
- Production incident requires immediate merge
- Quality gates blocking hotfix PR

**Process:**
1. Declare incident via on-call process
2. Prefix PR with `[INCIDENT-XXX]`
3. Mention `@kellerai/admins` for emergency override
4. Admin provides blanket override with incident reference
5. Merge immediately
6. Schedule post-incident review (within 24 hours)
7. Create follow-up tickets for proper fixes

### Issue: Override Not Working

**Symptoms:**
- Posted override command
- CodeRabbit didn't respond or reject override

**Common Causes:**
1. **Justification too short** (< 50 characters)
2. **Check name incorrect** (typo or wrong format)
3. **Check not available for override** (security check)
4. **Insufficient permissions** (elevated check requires admin)

**Resolution:**
1. Verify override syntax:
   ```
   @coderabbitai ignore <check-name> --reason "Justification 50+ chars"
   ```
2. Check available override list in documentation
3. For security checks, mention `@kellerai/security-team`
4. Ensure justification is substantive (not "it's fine")
