# KellerAI CodeRabbit Integration - Product Requirements Document

This PRD uses the Repository Planning Graph (RPG) methodology to structure KellerAI's comprehensive CodeRabbit integration project. The RPG method separates functional requirements (WHAT) from structural implementation (HOW), then connects them with explicit dependencies for topological execution.

**Project Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-10-14  
**Status:** Ready for TaskMaster Parsing

<overview>

## Problem Statement

KellerAI's development workflow currently lacks:
1. **Automated Code Quality Gates** - Manual code reviews are time-consuming and inconsistent
2. **Contextual Code Analysis** - Reviewers lack access to relevant documentation, standards, and architectural decisions during review
3. **Pre-merge Validation** - Issues discovered after merge increase technical debt and production bugs
4. **AI-Enhanced Workflows** - No integration between AI coding assistants (Claude Code) and automated quality checks
5. **Organizational Standards Enforcement** - Coding standards and architectural patterns not consistently applied

**Impact:** Development team spends 2+ hours per developer per day on code reviews, with 50% of production bugs traceable to inadequate pre-merge validation.

## Target Users

**Primary Users:**
- **Software Engineers** - Need fast, accurate code review feedback during development
- **Tech Leads** - Require visibility into code quality metrics and consistent standards enforcement
- **DevOps Engineers** - Need automated quality gates integrated into CI/CD pipelines

**Secondary Users:**
- **Product Managers** - Want visibility into development velocity and quality metrics
- **Security Team** - Require automated security vulnerability scanning
- **New Hires** - Need guidance on organizational coding standards

## Success Metrics

**Quantitative Metrics:**
- **Review Time Reduction:** From 2 hours/day/developer to <30 minutes/day (75% reduction)
- **Pre-PR Issue Detection:** 90% of issues caught before PR creation
- **Production Bug Reduction:** 50% fewer bugs reaching production
- **Code Quality Gates:** 95% PR compliance with organizational standards
- **Developer Satisfaction:** 4.5/5 rating on review quality and speed
- **ROI:** $23,200/month net profit (5,900% ROI)

**Qualitative Metrics:**
- Consistent application of coding standards across all repositories

## Test Pyramid

```
        /\
       /E2E\       ← 10% (End-to-end integration tests)
      /------\
     / Integ. \ ← 30% (Component integration tests)
    /----------\
   /   Unit     \ ← 60% (Validation and configuration tests)
  /--------------\
```

## Coverage Requirements

- **Configuration Validation:** 100% (all YAML validated, no syntax errors)
- **MCP Server Endpoints:** 90% (all tools tested with valid/invalid inputs)
- **Custom Check Logic:** 85% (all pass/fail scenarios tested)
- **CLI Workflows:** 80% (common workflows and error cases)

## Critical Test Scenarios

### PR Review Automation

**Happy path:**
- PR created → CodeRabbit reviews within 5 minutes → Posts structured feedback
- Expected: Review comments appear, summary generated, issues categorized by severity

**Edge cases:**
- Very large PR (1000+ lines) → Review completes without timeout
- PR with no changes → CodeRabbit acknowledges, no false positives
- Draft PR → Review skipped (if drafts disabled)

**Error cases:**
- Invalid .coderabbit.yaml syntax → CodeRabbit posts error comment with syntax issue
- CodeRabbit app not installed → Graceful failure with installation instructions
- Webhook delivery failure → Retry mechanism succeeds on second attempt

**Integration points:**
- Knowledge base files → Review references .cursorrules and CLAUDE.md guidance
- Issue tracking → PR linked to issue, validation report appears
- MCP servers → Review includes external context from MCP

### CLI Integration

**Happy path:**
- `coderabbit --type uncommitted` → Analyzes working directory → Returns findings in 2-5 minutes
- Claude Code runs `coderabbit --prompt-only` → Parses output → Fixes issues → Re-runs review
- Expected: Autonomous implement-review-fix cycle completes without human intervention

**Edge cases:**
- No git changes → CLI reports "No changes detected"
- Very large diff → CLI completes review but may take 15-30 minutes
- Background execution → CLI runs without blocking other terminal commands

**Error cases:**
- CLI not authenticated → Error with `coderabbit auth login` instructions
- Invalid command options → Help text displayed with correct syntax
- CodeRabbit service down → Timeout with retry suggestion

**Integration points:**
- Git hooks → Pre-commit hook runs CLI, allows override if needed
- Claude Code → Prompt templates successfully trigger autonomous workflows
- CI/CD → CLI runs in GitHub Actions, posts results as comment

### MCP Server Integration

**Happy path:**
- Review detects React import → Queries Context7 → Returns React documentation → References in comment
- Review finds architectural question → Queries custom KellerAI MCP → Returns ADR → Includes in feedback
- Expected: External context seamlessly integrated into review

**Edge cases:**
- MCP server slow (>5s response) → Review continues, context marked as "pending"
- Multiple MCP queries needed → All execute in parallel for speed
- MCP server returns no results → Review continues without context, notes unavailability

**Error cases:**
- MCP server unreachable → Review continues, logs error, notifies admin
- MCP server returns malformed data → Review ignores, logs error for investigation
- Authentication expired → Review attempts refresh, falls back to no context

**Integration points:**
- Context7 → Library documentation appears in reviews referencing those libraries
- Documentation MCP → ADRs and design docs referenced when relevant
- Custom MCP → Standards validation integrated into review feedback

### Pre-merge Check Validation

**Happy path:**
- All checks pass → PR shows green checkmark → Merge allowed
- One warning-mode check fails → Warning displayed → Merge allowed
- Expected: Quality gates enforce standards without blocking unnecessarily

**Edge cases:**
- Check marked "off" → Skipped, no impact on merge
- Override command used → Checks ignored, override noted in PR
- Multiple checks fail → All failures listed with specific remediation

**Error cases:**
- Check instructions unclear → CodeRabbit requests clarification, check marked inconclusive
- Check infinite loop (bad regex) → Timeout after 30s, check marked failed
- Check validation error → Error logged, check disabled automatically

**Integration points:**
- Request changes workflow → Error-mode failures block merge via GitHub/GitLab
- Custom MCP → Checks query standards and ADRs for validation
- Knowledge base → Checks reference documented exemptions

## Test Generation Guidelines

All integration tests should follow this pattern:

```python
def test_integration_<component>_<scenario>_<expected>():
    """
    Test <component> integration with <dependency> when <scenario>.
    
    Expected behavior: <expected outcome>
    """
    # Arrange: Set up test data and preconditions
    
    # Act: Execute the integration
    
    # Assert: Verify expected outcomes
    
    # Cleanup: Reset state for next test
```

**Example:**
```python
def test_integration_pr_review_with_mcp_context_includes_adr_reference():
    """
    Test PR review integration with custom MCP when architectural change detected.
    
    Expected behavior: Review comment references relevant ADR from MCP.
    """
    # Arrange
    pr = create_test_pr_with_architectural_change()
    mcp_server = mock_kellerai_mcp_with_adr_database()
    
    # Act
    review_result = coderabbit.review_pr(pr, mcp_servers=[mcp_server])
    
    # Assert
    assert "ADR-042" in review_result.comments
    assert "database access patterns" in review_result.context
    
    # Cleanup
    delete_test_pr(pr)
```

## Validation Checkpoints

Each phase includes validation tasks that must pass before proceeding:

**Phase 1 Validation:**
- 10+ test PRs reviewed with 4/5 quality rating
- Team successfully uses @coderabbitai commands
- Knowledge base files referenced in reviews

**Phase 2 Validation:**
- 3+ autonomous workflows complete end-to-end
- CLI installed and authenticated on all dev machines
- Average review time < 10 minutes for uncommitted changes

**Phase 3 Validation:**
- 20+ test PRs show MCP context usage 60%+ of time
- All 4 MCP servers respond to test queries
- Context accuracy rated 4.5/5 by team

**Phase 4 Validation:**
- 20+ test PRs validate all quality gates
- Error-mode failures successfully block merge
- 95% compliance rate achieved

**Phase 5 Validation:**
- 4 weeks of performance data collected
- Review time reduced to < 5 minutes average
- Team satisfaction 4.5/5 or higher

### Configuration & Documentation
- **YAML:** Configuration file format (.coderabbit.yaml)
- **Markdown:** Documentation and knowledge base
- **Git:** Version control for all configurations

## Key Design Decisions

### Decision: Central Configuration Repository Pattern
**Rationale:** 
- Single source of truth for organization-wide standards
- Reduces configuration duplication across 50+ repositories
- Version-controlled changes with full audit trail
- Easy to update standards across entire organization

**Trade-offs:**
- Repositories lose some autonomy (mitigated by override capability)
- Central repo becomes critical dependency (mitigated by git's distributed nature)
- Changes affect all repos (mitigated by testing and gradual rollout)

**Alternatives considered:**
- Individual repo configs (rejected: too much duplication, inconsistent standards)
- UI-only settings (rejected: not version controlled, harder to review changes)
- Monorepo with shared config (rejected: organizational structure doesn't support)

### Decision: MCP for Context Enrichment vs Direct API Integration
**Rationale:**
- MCP provides standardized protocol for multiple sources
- Easier to add new context sources over time
- CodeRabbit native MCP support reduces integration complexity
- Future-proof as MCP ecosystem grows

**Trade-offs:**
- MCP adds dependency on MCP server availability (mitigated by graceful fallback)
- Custom MCP requires hosting infrastructure (minimal cost)
- Learning curve for MCP development (offset by comprehensive docs)

**Alternatives considered:**
- Direct API calls to each service (rejected: more complex, harder to maintain)
- Webhook-based integration (rejected: higher latency, more failure modes)
- Embedded context in git repo (rejected: doesn't scale, stale data risk)

### Decision: Phased Rollout Over Big Bang Launch
**Rationale:**
- Reduces risk of integration issues affecting all teams
- Allows learning and adjustment between phases
- Easier to gather feedback and optimize before full deployment
- Teams can adopt at their own pace within phase timelines

**Trade-offs:**
- Longer overall timeline (10+ weeks vs 2-3 weeks big bang)
- Inconsistent experience during transition (mitigated by clear communication)
- Parallel maintenance of old and new processes briefly (acceptable temporary cost)

**Alternatives considered:**
- Big bang launch (rejected: too risky, hard to roll back)
- Per-team rollout (rejected: creates organizational silos, inconsistent experience)
- Features-as-available (rejected: unclear completion criteria, confusing for users)

### Decision: Warning Mode First, Error Mode After Validation
**Rationale:**
- Prevents team frustration from false positives blocking work
- Allows refinement of check logic based on real data
- Builds team trust in automated checks gradually
- Easier to get buy-in when checks are informational initially

**Trade-offs:**
- Quality gates not fully enforced during Phase 4 (acceptable for 1-2 weeks)
- Some PRs may merge with issues during warning period (monitored and tracked)
- Two-step configuration change (warning → error mode) adds tasks

**Alternatives considered:**
- Error mode from start (rejected: high risk of false positives, team pushback)
- Warning mode permanently (rejected: defeats purpose of quality gates)
- Per-check decision on mode (rejected: too complex, inconsistent experience)

### Decision: Claude Code as Primary AI Workflow vs Other Tools
**Rationale:**
- Claude Code has direct CLI access for running CodeRabbit
- Strong support for background execution and prompt parsing
- Already in use at KellerAI (no new tool adoption required)
- Excellent at parsing AI-optimized output (--prompt-only mode)

**Trade-offs:**
- Vendor lock-in to Anthropic ecosystem (mitigated by standard CLI, works with other tools)
- Requires Claude Code subscription per developer (already have)
- Less IDE integration than Cursor/Windsurf (acceptable for workflow-focused tasks)

**Alternatives considered:**
- GitHub Copilot (rejected: no CLI access, limited autonomous capabilities)
- Cursor/Windsurf (considered as complement, not replacement - team can use both)
- Custom automation scripts (rejected: reinventing wheel, Claude Code superior)

</architecture>

<risks>

## Technical Risks

### Risk: CodeRabbit Review Quality Below Expectations
- **Impact:** High - Low-quality reviews frustrate team, reduce adoption
- **Likelihood:** Medium - AI can have false positives, misunderstand context
- **Mitigation:**
  - Start with "chill" review profile (fewer, higher-confidence comments)
  - Invest heavily in knowledge base (CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, standards)
  - Use MCP servers to provide additional context
  - Iterative learning via @coderabbitai commands to train AI
  - Phase 1 includes 10+ test PRs with quality validation (4/5 minimum)
- **Fallback:** 
  - Adjust review profile to less aggressive settings
  - Disable specific checks that generate false positives
  - Supplement with manual code review in critical areas
  - Escalate persistent quality issues to CodeRabbit support

### Risk: MCP Server Downtime or Slow Response
- **Impact:** Medium - Reviews lack context, may miss important standards
- **Likelihood:** Low - MCP servers relatively simple, low failure rate
- **Mitigation:**
  - Implement graceful degradation (reviews continue without MCP context)
  - Set MCP timeout to 5 seconds (don't block reviews waiting for context)
  - Monitor MCP server health and response times
  - Custom MCP hosted on reliable infrastructure with monitoring
  - Context7 is SaaS with high availability
- **Fallback:**
  - Reviews proceed without MCP context (still valuable)
  - Notification sent to admin for investigation
  - Cached MCP responses used when available
  - Manual review prioritized when MCP context critical

### Risk: CLI Installation or Authentication Failures
- **Impact:** Medium - Developers can't use autonomous workflows or pre-commit hooks
- **Likelihood:** Medium - Installation works on most systems but edge cases exist
- **Mitigation:**
  - Test installation script on multiple OS versions before rollout
  - Provide troubleshooting guide for common issues
  - Dedicated support channel during Phase 2 rollout
  - Fall back to PR reviews if CLI unavailable
  - Document system requirements clearly upfront
- **Fallback:**
  - Developers use PR reviews exclusively (still valuable)
  - IT support helps troubleshoot installation issues
  - Alternative authentication methods (API token fallback)
  - Containerized CLI environment as last resort

### Risk: Pre-merge Check False Positives Block Valid PRs
- **Impact:** High - Team frustrated, productivity decreased, checks disabled
- **Likelihood:** Medium - Custom checks use heuristics, may misclassify
- **Mitigation:**
  - Start ALL checks in warning mode during Phase 4
  - Validate with 20+ diverse test PRs before error mode
  - Clear documentation on override process with justification
  - Iterative refinement based on false positive reports
  - Regular review of override usage to identify check issues
- **Fallback:**
  - Quickly switch problematic checks to warning or off mode
  - Refine check logic based on false positive analysis
  - Provide team training on override with justification
  - Tech lead approval for security/breaking change overrides

### Risk: Integration Complexity Leads to Extended Timeline
- **Impact:** Medium - Delayed value delivery, potential scope creep
- **Likelihood:** Medium - 5 phases with many dependencies, unforeseen issues likely
- **Mitigation:**
  - Detailed dependency graph prevents starting tasks prematurely
  - Each phase has clear entry/exit criteria and validation
  - Buffer time built into estimates (conservative timelines)
  - Weekly progress reviews to catch delays early
  - Prioritize most valuable features (PR automation) in Phase 1
- **Fallback:**
  - Descope optional features (git hooks, optional checks)
  - Extend timelines if needed (quality over speed)
  - Bring in additional resources for bottlenecks
  - Deliver phases incrementally (Phase 1-3 provide 80% of value)

## Organizational Risks

### Risk: Low Team Adoption and Usage
- **Impact:** High - Investment wasted, goals not achieved
- **Likelihood:** Medium - Change management challenge, learning curve
- **Mitigation:**
  - Executive sponsorship and clear communication of benefits
  - Early involvement of tech leads and influential developers
  - Comprehensive training (Phase 1, 2, 3, 4 include training tasks)
  - Celebrate early wins and share success stories
  - Gather and act on feedback quickly
  - Make it easy to use (clear docs, prompt templates, support)
- **Fallback:**
  - Pilot with enthusiastic volunteers first, expand after success
  - Identify and address specific adoption barriers (training, tooling)
  - Adjust configuration based on team feedback
  - Consider incentives for early adopters (recognition, time savings)

### Risk: Resistance to AI-Based Code Review
- **Impact:** Medium - Team skepticism, reluctance to trust AI feedback
- **Likelihood:** Low-Medium - Some developers prefer human-only review
- **Mitigation:**
  - Emphasize AI as augmentation, not replacement of human review
  - Show examples of issues AI catches that humans miss
  - Transparent about AI limitations (false positives expected)
  - Human reviewers always have final say
  - Tech lead endorsement and modeling of good usage
- **Fallback:**
  - Make CodeRabbit optional for resistant team members initially
  - Pair skeptics with advocates to see benefits firsthand
  - Focus on time savings and reduced review burden (quantify)
  - Address specific concerns through education

### Risk: Over-reliance on Automation Reduces Human Review Quality
- **Impact:** Medium - Human reviewers become less engaged, miss nuanced issues
- **Likelihood:** Low - Strong code review culture at KellerAI
- **Mitigation:**
  - Training emphasizes AI finds mechanical issues, humans focus on design/architecture
  - CodeRabbit feedback labeled as "AI suggestions" (human judgment required)
  - Maintain human review requirement for all PRs (AI is first pass)
  - Regular retrospectives on review quality
- **Fallback:**
  - Adjust PR templates to explicitly require human reviewer attention to specific areas
  - Rotate human reviewers to keep engagement high
  - Metrics track both AI and human review effectiveness

### Risk: Cost Overruns from Higher Usage Than Expected
- **Impact:** Low - Budget exceeded, may need to reduce usage or seats
- **Likelihood:** Low - Pro tier has predictable per-seat pricing
- **Mitigation:**
  - Budget for 10% more seats than current team size (growth buffer)
  - Monitor usage monthly and adjust if needed
  - Set up billing alerts at 80% and 100% of budget
  - ROI so strong ($23,200/month profit) that cost increases acceptable
- **Fallback:**
  - Reduce to most critical repositories if budget tight
  - Negotiate enterprise pricing if usage very high
  - Re-evaluate ROI and adjust budget if needed

## Security & Compliance Risks

### Risk: Sensitive Code or Data Exposed to CodeRabbit (Third Party)
- **Impact:** High - Data breach, compliance violation, loss of IP
- **Likelihood:** Very Low - CodeRabbit SOC 2 Type II certified
- **Mitigation:**
  - Review CodeRabbit security certifications (SOC 2, GDPR)
  - Configure data retention policies appropriately
  - Use knowledge_base.opt_out if data sensitivity very high
  - Legal/security team review before production deployment
  - Private repos on Pro tier have additional protections
- **Fallback:**
  - Limit CodeRabbit to non-sensitive repositories initially
  - Use self-hosted CodeRabbit Enterprise if sensitivity extreme
  - Implement additional access controls and auditing

### Risk: API Keys or Secrets Leaked Through Configuration Files
- **Impact:** Medium - Unauthorized access to CodeRabbit, MCP servers
- **Likelihood:** Low - Keys stored in environment variables, not git
- **Mitigation:**
  - All keys in .env (gitignored), never in .yaml or code
  - Rotate keys every 30 days proactively
  - Use service accounts with minimal required permissions
  - Monitor key usage for anomalies
- **Fallback:**
  - Immediate key rotation if leak detected
  - Audit access logs for unauthorized usage
  - Implement IP whitelisting where possible

### Risk: Custom MCP Server Vulnerabilities
- **Impact:** Medium - Unauthorized access to organizational standards/ADRs
- **Likelihood:** Low - Simple read-only server, limited attack surface
- **Mitigation:**
  - Code review for custom MCP before deployment
  - Read-only data access (MCP never writes)
  - Input validation on all tool parameters
  - Regular security updates for dependencies
  - Host on internal network with firewall rules
- **Fallback:**
  - Disable custom MCP if vulnerability discovered
  - Incident response plan for security issues
  - Fall back to knowledge base files only

### Risk: Malicious Code Injected via @coderabbitai Commands
- **Impact:** Low - AI could be prompted to generate harmful suggestions
- **Likelihood:** Very Low - CodeRabbit has prompt injection protections
- **Mitigation:**
  - Team training on responsible @coderabbitai usage
  - Monitor command usage for anomalies
  - CodeRabbit's built-in safety filters
- **Fallback:**
  - Restrict @coderabbitai command usage if abused
  - Review and revert malicious suggestions in PRs

## Dependency Risks

### Risk: CodeRabbit Service Outage
- **Impact:** High - No PR reviews during outage
- **Likelihood:** Low - SaaS provider, high availability expected
- **Mitigation:**
  - CodeRabbit SLA guarantees uptime (Pro tier)
  - Human reviewers continue working during outage
  - CLI can still run (may have degraded features)
- **Fallback:**
  - Temporary return to human-only review
  - Queue PRs for review when service returns
  - Escalate to CodeRabbit support for extended outages

### Risk: GitHub/GitLab API Changes Break Integration
- **Impact:** Medium - Webhook failures, review comments fail to post
- **Likelihood:** Low - Stable APIs, CodeRabbit handles updates
- **Mitigation:**
  - CodeRabbit team monitors platform API changes
  - Test integration after major GitHub/GitLab updates
- **Fallback:**
  - CodeRabbit support handles API compatibility
  - Use CLI as temporary workaround if webhooks broken

### Risk: Claude Code Compatibility Issues with CLI
- **Impact:** Low - Autonomous workflows don't work as expected
- **Likelihood:** Low - Standard CLI tool, well-supported
- **Mitigation:**
  - Test Claude Code integration thoroughly in Phase 2
  - Document exact prompt patterns that work
  - Provide fallback manual CLI workflow
- **Fallback:**
  - Developers run CLI manually instead of via Claude Code
  - Explore alternative AI assistants (Cursor, Windsurf)
  - Direct shell script automation if needed

### Risk: MCP Protocol Changes or Deprecation
- **Impact:** Medium - Context enrichment broken, MCP servers need rewrite
- **Likelihood:** Very Low - MCP is new but designed for stability
- **Mitigation:**
  - Use stable MCP protocol version
  - Monitor MCP community for breaking changes
  - CodeRabbit announces MCP changes with migration guides
- **Fallback:**
  - Temporary context loss while MCP updated
  - Fall back to knowledge base files only
  - Re-implement context via alternative methods if MCP deprecated

## Mitigation Strategy Summary

**Risk Management Approach:**
1. **Prevention:** Mitigate high-likelihood or high-impact risks proactively
2. **Detection:** Monitor for risk indicators throughout implementation
3. **Response:** Clear fallback plans for all critical risks
4. **Learning:** Retrospectives after each phase to identify new risks

**Risk Review Cadence:**
- Weekly during implementation (Phases 1-4)
- Monthly after production deployment (Phase 5+)
- Immediate review if critical risk materializes

**Risk Escalation:**
- Technical Lead: Handles technical and organizational risks
- Security Team: Handles security and compliance risks
- Executive Sponsor: Handles cost overruns and adoption risks

## Glossary

**ADR (Architecture Decision Record):** Document capturing important architectural decision with context, options, and rationale

**Central Configuration Repository:** Special repository (kellerai/coderabbit) containing organization-wide default CodeRabbit settings

**Context Enrichment:** Process of adding external context (docs, standards, ADRs) to code reviews via MCP servers

**Custom Check:** Organization-specific quality gate defined in natural language, enforced pre-merge

**Knowledge Base:** Collection of files (.cursorrules, CLAUDE.md, standards) CodeRabbit uses for contextual reviews

**MCP (Model Context Protocol):** Standardized protocol for connecting AI systems to external data sources

**Pre-merge Check:** Automated validation that runs before PR merge, can block merge if fails (error mode)

**Request Changes Workflow:** GitHub/GitLab feature where CodeRabbit marks PR as "Changes requested" to block merge

**Review Profile:** CodeRabbit setting controlling review intensity (chill = fewer comments, assertive = thorough)

**RPG Method:** Repository Planning Graph methodology for structuring PRDs with explicit dependencies

**Scope Validation:** Process of checking if PR changes align with linked issue requirements

**@coderabbitai Command:** Interactive command in PR comments to ask CodeRabbit questions or request actions

## Open Questions

### Pre-Implementation Questions
- [ ] **Issue Tracking Choice:** Jira or Linear? (Decision needed by Phase 3)
  - Factors: Existing tools, team preference, API capabilities
  - Recommendation: Use existing tool if possible, Linear if choosing new

- [ ] **Documentation Platform:** Confluence or Notion? (Decision needed by Phase 3)
  - Factors: Existing usage, content structure, API access
  - Recommendation: Confluence for enterprise, Notion for smaller teams

- [ ] **Custom MCP Hosting:** Where to host KellerAI standards MCP? (Decision needed by Phase 3)
  - Options: AWS EC2, Kubernetes pod, serverless function
  - Recommendation: Small EC2 instance or existing k8s cluster

- [ ] **Git Hook Adoption:** Mandatory or optional pre-commit hooks? (Decision needed by Phase 2)
  - Factors: Team preference, development workflow, override complexity
  - Recommendation: Optional with clear instructions, let teams decide

### Post-Implementation Questions
- [ ] **Expand to More Platforms:** Should we integrate with Azure DevOps or Bitbucket?
  - Timeline: Evaluate after Phase 5 based on repository distribution
  
- [ ] **Custom Check Library:** Which additional custom checks should we create?
  - Timeline: Ongoing based on team needs and production issues

- [ ] **Cross-repository Learning:** Should we enable global learnings across all private repos?
  - Timeline: Phase 5, after learning quality validated per-repo

- [ ] **Advanced MCP Servers:** Should we build MCP for other systems (Slack, Datadog, APM)?
  - Timeline: Phase 5+, if context needs identified

# How TaskMaster Will Parse This PRD

When you run `task-master parse-prd kellerai-coderabbit-integration-prd.txt --research`, TaskMaster will:

## 1. Extract Capabilities → Main Tasks

Each `### Capability:` section becomes a top-level task:

**Generated Main Tasks:**
- Task 1: PR Review Automation
- Task 2: CLI Integration
- Task 3: Context Enrichment
- Task 4: Quality Gate Enforcement
- Task 5: Central Configuration Management

## 2. Extract Features → Subtasks

Each `#### Feature:` becomes a subtask under its capability:

**Example for Task 1 (PR Review Automation):**
- Subtask 1.1: Automatic PR Analysis
- Subtask 1.2: Issue Tracking Integration
- Subtask 1.3: Interactive Review Commands
- Subtask 1.4: Knowledge Base Learning

## 3. Parse Dependencies → Task Dependencies

From `<dependency-graph>`:

**Foundation Layer (no dependencies):**
- CodeRabbit Account Setup
- GitHub/GitLab Organization Access
- Development Environment Baseline

**PR Automation Layer (depends on Foundation):**
- CodeRabbit App Installation depends on [CodeRabbit Account Setup, GitHub/GitLab Organization Access]
- Central Configuration Repository depends on [CodeRabbit App Installation]

**Result:** TaskMaster creates dependency graph ensuring topological execution order

## 4. Extract Phases → Task Priorities

From `<implementation-roadmap>`:

**Phase 0 tasks:** Highest priority (must be done first)
**Phase 1 tasks:** High priority (depends on Phase 0)
**Phase 2 tasks:** Medium priority (depends on Phase 1)
**Phase 3 tasks:** Medium priority (depends on Phase 1, parallel with Phase 2 possible)
**Phase 4 tasks:** Lower priority (depends on Phase 1 and 3)
**Phase 5 tasks:** Lowest priority (depends on all previous)

## 5. Use Test Strategy → Test Generation

From `<test-strategy>`:

TaskMaster AI's Surgical Test Generator will use test scenarios during implementation:
- **Security Check Test:** Create PR with hardcoded credential → verify check fails
- **CLI Workflow Test:** Run implement-review-fix cycle → verify autonomous completion
- **MCP Integration Test:** Query Context7 for React docs → verify documentation appears in review

## Why RPG Structure Matters for TaskMaster

**Traditional Flat PRD:**
```
- Implement PR reviews
- Set up CLI
- Add MCP servers
- Create quality gates
```
❌ No clear dependencies → arbitrary order → potential failures → rework needed

**RPG-Structured PRD:**
```
Phase 0: Foundation (CodeRabbit account, GitHub access)
  ↓
Phase 1: PR Automation (depends on Foundation)
  ↓
Phase 2: CLI Integration (depends on PR Automation)
Phase 3: MCP Servers (depends on PR Automation, parallel with Phase 2)
  ↓
Phase 4: Quality Gates (depends on PR Automation + MCP Servers)
  ↓
Phase 5: Optimization (depends on all previous)
```
✅ Explicit dependencies → correct execution order → parallel where possible → efficient implementation

## TaskMaster Commands After Parsing

```bash
# Parse this PRD
task-master parse-prd .taskmaster/docs/kellerai-coderabbit-integration-prd.txt --research

# View generated tasks
task-master list

# Analyze task complexity
task-master analyze-complexity --research

# Expand complex tasks into subtasks
task-master expand --all --research

# Show next available task (respecting dependencies)
task-master next

# Start implementing Phase 0
task-master show <phase-0-task-id>
task-master set-status --id=<task-id> --status=in-progress

# Complete task and move to next
task-master set-status --id=<task-id> --status=done
task-master next  # Shows next task based on dependency graph
```

## Expected TaskMaster Output

After parsing, you should see approximately:

- **Main Tasks:** 5 (one per capability)
- **Subtasks:** 20-25 (features under capabilities)
- **Implementation Tasks:** 40-50 (from implementation roadmap phases)
- **Validation Tasks:** 10-15 (from test strategy and phase exit criteria)

**Total:** ~75-90 tasks organized in dependency-aware structure

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Use --research flag:** Leverages Perplexity for context-aware task generation
2. **Review generated tasks:** TaskMaster AI may combine or split tasks intelligently
3. **Update as needed:** Use `task-master update-task` to refine task descriptions
4. **Track progress:** Regular `task-master list` shows completion status
5. **Leverage expansion:** `task-master expand --id=<complex-task>` breaks down as needed
