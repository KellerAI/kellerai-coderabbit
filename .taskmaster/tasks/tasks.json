Implementation includes PR→Linear sync flow with automatic issue creation and deduplication (85% similarity threshold using difflib), Linear→PR sync flow with status updates and comment posting, intelligent scope validation algorithm using keyword extraction and file analysis, robust error handling with exponential backoff retry logic, and complete testing framework with 4 test scenarios. Authentication testing script (scripts/test-linear-auth.sh) validates API connectivity. Implementation guide provides 1,000+ lines of detailed documentation across 10 sections covering architecture diagrams, data flow diagrams, component implementations, validation algorithms, status mapping configurations, and deployment procedures. All sync logic components are production-ready and documented for immediate deployment to complete the bidirectional webhook integration between CodeRabbit PR reviews and Linear issue tracking.\n</info added on 2025-10-14T21:45:05.609Z>",
