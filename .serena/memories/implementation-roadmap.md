### Phase 4: Pre-merge Checks (Weeks 7-8)
**Objective:** Enforce quality gates and organizational standards

**Tasks:**
1. Configure Built-in Checks
   ```yaml
   reviews:
     pre_merge_checks:
       docstrings:
         mode: "error"
         threshold: 80
       title:
         mode: "warning"
       description:
         mode: "error"
       issue_assessment:
         mode: "warning"
   ```

2. Create Custom Checks
   - **Breaking Changes Check:** Require CHANGELOG.md documentation
   - **Security Review Check:** Flag sensitive data patterns
   - **Architecture Compliance:** Validate against design patterns
   - **Performance Check:** Flag performance-critical changes
   - **Test Coverage Check:** Ensure adequate test coverage

3. Enable Request Changes Workflow
   - Block merges for error-mode failures
   - Configure override permissions
   - Set up notification workflows

**Success Metrics:**
- 95% PR compliance with quality gates
- 50% reduction in production bugs
- Zero breaking changes without documentation

**Deliverables:**
- All quality gates configured
- Custom checks implemented and tested
- Team trained on override process

### Phase 5: Advanced Optimization (Weeks 9+)
**Objective:** Fine-tune and scale integration

**Tasks:**
1. Advanced Learnings
   - Repository-wide preferences for patterns
   - Line-specific context for complex code
   - Cross-repository learning enablement

2. Performance Optimization
   - Configure caching strategies
   - Optimize review scope and depth
   - Fine-tune MCP tool selection

3. Team Collaboration
   - Multi-team learning synthesis
   - Consistent standards across projects
   - Advanced custom check refinement

**Success Metrics:**
- Review time < 5 minutes average
- 98% developer satisfaction
- 70% reduction in review comments

**Deliverables:**
- Optimized configuration
- Performance metrics dashboard
- Team best practices documented

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Review quality issues:** Start with warning mode; iterate based on feedback
- **False positives:** Use learnings to train out; refine check instructions
- **Performance issues:** Scope reviews appropriately; use incremental workflows
- **Integration failures:** Test in staging; gradual rollout

### Organizational Risks
- **Low team adoption:** Strong onboarding; show value fast
- **Resistance to AI tools:** Pilot with volunteers; share wins
- **Over-reliance on automation:** Emphasize human review importance
- **Cost overruns:** Monitor usage; set budget alerts

### Security Risks
- **Code exposure:** CodeRabbit SOC 2 certified; verify compliance
- **API key leakage:** Rotate keys; use environment vars
- **Unauthorized access:** SSO/SAML; role-based access control

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Phased Rollout:** Start with 1-2 repositories; expand after validation
2. **Continuous Monitoring:** Track metrics weekly; adjust based on data
3. **Training & Support:** Comprehensive onboarding; internal champions
4. **Fallback Plans:** Keep existing review process; maintain manual option
